# Coral_Light_modelcode
Model code and data files used to perform simulations for study on a corals dependence on light and temperature, part of the study of Kruijt, A. L., et al. 2024 (under review).

Paper abstract:
The latitudinal range of shallow-water tropical corals is controlled by temperature, and presently limited to waters warmer than 16-18 째C yearround. However, even during Cenozoic climates with such temperatures in polar regions, coral reefs are not found beyond >50째 latitude. Here, we test the hypothesis that daily available solar radiation limited poleward expansion of coral reefs during warm climates, using a new box model of shallow marine coral calcification. Our results show that calcification rates start to decline beyond 40째 and more quickly beyond 50째, suggesting that winter light intensity and day length prohibits further poleward expansion. This implies that fossil coral reef distribution is not a robust proxy for water temperatures and that poleward expansion of reefs is not an expected carbon cycle feedback of climate warming.
