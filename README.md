# Coral_Light_modelcode
Model code and data files used to perform simulations for study on a corals dependence on light and temperature, part of the study of Kruijt, A. L., et al. 2024 (under review).

Paper abstract:
The latitudinal range of shallow-water tropical corals is controlled by temperature, and presently limited to waters warmer than 16-18 째C yearround. However, even during Cenozoic climates with such temperatures in polar regions, coral reefs are not found beyond >50째 latitude. Here, we test the hypothesis that daily available solar radiation limited poleward expansion of coral reefs during warm climates, using a new box model of shallow marine coral calcification. Our results show that calcification rates start to decline beyond 40째 and more quickly beyond 50째, suggesting that winter light intensity and day length prohibits further poleward expansion. This implies that fossil coral reef distribution is not a robust proxy for water temperatures and that poleward expansion of reefs is not an expected carbon cycle feedback of climate warming.

R code works with:
R version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15 ucrt) -- "Shortstop Beagle"
Copyright (C) 2023 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)

Files are in r-markdown and r format.

Installation steps:
--> r version: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
--> r markdown: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html
--> r studio: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html

Running the code:
To run the code on your own device, dowload the entire repository. To perform the simulations as they were done for the paper, follow the steps in the MASTER_script in the model_code folder. The script reads-in the required temperature data from the data_files folder. Model output is stored in the model_output folder.

(This is not necessary for the simulations but) if you want to download the modern ocean temperature data from NOAA, follow the steps in the ocean_atlas_modernTemp_extraction.R file.

Making the figures:
To re-do the figures as presented in the paper, the plotting scripts in the model_code folder can be run. These read-in the original model output from the simulations presented in the paper, which are stored in the output_for_plotting folder.
